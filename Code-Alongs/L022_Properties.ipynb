    "# Properties (sing. Property, sv. Egenskap)\n",
    "A property is a python construction (or OOP concept) that works similar to an attribute, with the difference being that an attribute stores (and reads) the value directly to memory, while a property uses **\"getter\"** and **\"setter\"** methods to change the values of the property.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the \"outside\" (of the class definition) when a property of an object is set, the objects internal setter method will be called to handle the operation. This method is marked in the class definition by a decorator called {name}.setter (where \"name is the name of the property)\n",
    "\n",
    "When the property is read (from the  \"outside\"), the objects internal getter method will be called to return a value. The getter method is marked in the class definition by a decorator called @property"
